# CEGMem: counterexample-guided repair with a typed memory of refuted attempts

Replication package. All results are regenerated from a single seed; no number
in the paper is written by hand.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # then fill in your API key and model prices
python3 scripts/fetch_condefects.py    # clones the benchmark, checks the layout
```

`fetch_condefects.py` can only clone the *code*. ConDefects ships its contest
test data as a separate `Test.zip` (OneDrive or Baidu Drive — the script prints
both links); drop that archive into `external/ConDefects/` and re-run the
script to unpack and verify it. Without `Test/` there are no inputs, so there
is no oracle.

## Reproduce

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_oracle.py                        # freezes data/tasks.json
python3 scripts/measure_pi.py                             # -> data/pi_pilot.json
python3 scripts/build_strata.py                           # freezes data/strata.json

python3 scripts/run_eval.py --modes no_memory --force-full-budget   # E1
python3 scripts/run_eval.py --modes untyped typed --check-overfit   # E2

python3 scripts/freeze_results.py --experiment main       # -> data/results_real.json
python3 scripts/analyze.py                                # -> data/analysis.json
python3 scripts/fit_theory.py                             # -> data/theory_fit.json
python3 figures/make_figures.py
python3 scripts/check_consistency.py   # asserts every reported number matches
```

E1 *is* the main grid's no-memory arm. It runs to the full budget so that
`pi_hat` and `q_hat` are estimated without early-stopping bias; the summary
step then truncates its rounds back at the first accept, so the arm stays
comparable to the memory arms it is tabulated against. Do not run `no_memory`
a second time without `--force-full-budget` — that is a different cell, and
`scripts/analyze.py` will refuse to pool the two.

`run_eval.py` is resumable and caches every model call on disk, so an
interrupted run costs nothing to restart. Both properties come from the same
place: every episode's id, typing-noise RNG, and per-round cache nonce are
derived from its experiment cell, so a re-run reproduces the episode exactly
and rewrites its own rows rather than appending a second copy.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `src/adapter.py` | loads a ConDefects fault and its contest test pool |
| `src/sandbox.py` | runs a candidate program on one input under a timeout |
| `src/oracle.py` | counterexample oracle over the shipped test pool |
| `src/typer.py` | failure-type function, two granularities |
| `src/memory.py` | no-memory / untyped / typed stores |
| `src/loop.py` | the repair loop (Algorithm 1) |
| `src/llm.py` | model client with on-disk cache and a cost meter |
| `scripts/` | experiment driver and consistency checker |
| `paper/` | LaTeX source (IEEEtran) |
| `data/`, `cache/`, `external/` | generated or vendored; not tracked |

## Benchmark

We evaluate on the Python subset of [ConDefects](https://github.com/appmlk/ConDefects):
real faults from AtCoder submissions, each paired with the same author's
accepted version, the annotated fault lines, and the contest's own test data.
Two properties make it the right fit here.

A counterexample oracle is possible at all. Every test input arrives with the
output AtCoder accepted, so a refutation is a concrete input on which the
candidate's stdout differs from the expected output — not the pass/fail bit a
benchmark exposing only an opaque test suite would give, which cannot support
the class-level refutation this work studies. The reference implementation is
visible to the oracle only and is never placed in a model prompt; the sampled
oracle used inside the loop is separated from the full-pool audit that decides
whether an accepted patch was merely plausible (`is_truly_correct`).

The faults postdate the benchmarks LLM training corpora were built from. That
is ConDefects' reason for existing, and it is a *relative* guarantee, not an
absolute one: the corpus covers October 2021 – June 2024, which sits inside the
training window of any recent model. `scripts/validate_oracle.py --since/--until`
selects a time slice, and the honest position for a model with a later cutoff is
either to report contamination as a threat to validity or to re-mine AtCoder
past that cutoff using ConDefects' own collection protocol.

One further consequence of using real submissions: a program carries no problem
statement, so its intended output format is underdetermined by the source
alone. Each prompt therefore includes two worked input/output examples from the
task's test data (`src.adapter.Task.spec_note`), identically in all three memory
conditions.

## Cost

Every model call records input tokens, output tokens and cost to
`data/calls.jsonl`. The driver aborts when the configured cap is reached.
